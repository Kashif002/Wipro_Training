//Java Exception Handling
//
//Throwable (Base Class)
//
//
//Error  -- (JVM/ System Level issues) errors which we cannot handle  ( OutOfMemoryError ), errors cannot be predicted , Usually we cannot 
//catch in code , serious issues that may occur suddenly  for(i=0 ; i<n;i++)
//An error is a serious issue that arises in the JVM or system environment , 
//ususally outside the application control . It is also a throwable object , but it 
//indicates problems that are not meant to be caught or handled in normal code by the programmers or Developers
//
//eg: JVM runs out of memory 
//Infinite recursion or a loop which causes a stack overflow
//
//These are not recoverable .
//
//Exception  --- Application Level issues -- which is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program during execution. It is 
//an object that represents an error or unexpected situation that can be handled gracefully using 
//try , catch and finally blocks  also includes throw and throws key word.
//
//try:=  business logic  --  you think that may be the code is risky
//catch := handle immediately the exception after occured in try block 
//finally block will execute in both the cases 
//
//
//Runtime Exceptions  ( Unchecked Exceptions ) 
//
//ArithmeticExceptions :  DivideByZero
//
//IllegalArgumentException : NumberFormatException / IllegalThreadStateException
//
//ClassCastException : It may throw when an object is cast to a class it's not an instance of
//
//IndexOutOfBoundExcept : for invalid retreiving the values from the array or string for a invalid index range
//
//Null Pointer Exception : which is pointing to null reference;
//
//
//Compile Time Exceptions (Checked Exception)
//
//classNotFoundexception
//
//filenotfoundexception
//
//InterruptedException
//instantiation exception
//
